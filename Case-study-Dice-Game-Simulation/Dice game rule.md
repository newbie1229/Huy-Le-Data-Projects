**Dice Game** ðŸŽ²
- How to play: you are standing at step 0 of a stair and roll a dice, if you get
    1-2 points: 1 step down
    3-5 points: 1 step up
    6 points: roll again and walk up the resulting step
- Some simple rules:
    You can't go below step 0
    You are a bit clumsy and have a 0,1% chance of falling down the stairs and start over at step 0
- Suppose you have 100 rolls and bet your friends that you will reach step 60.
What is your chance to win this bet ?
