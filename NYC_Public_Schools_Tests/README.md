**🏫 Project Overview:**
In this project, I have used Pandas to explore performance data of public schools in New York city, here is what I found:
- **Schools leading in math results:** Identified schools whose students scored should be at least 640 out of 800 in the SAT math section.
- **Top 10 performing schools:** Based on the combined SAT scores (math, reading, and writing).
- **Borough with the largest SAT score variation:** find the borough with the largest standard deviation in the combined SAT score (indicating possible inconsistency in school quality).
