**In this project, I have used Pandas and NumPy to answer 2 interesting questions about Netflix movies**
- What is the most frequent movie duration in the 1990s decade ?
- How many action movies in the 1990s with duration less than 90 minues, hence labelled as "short action movies" ?

**These are skills used by me in this project:**
- Basic data filtering using NumPy ✔️
- Basic data manipulation using Pandas DataFrame ✔️
- Working with CSV file using Pandas ✔️
