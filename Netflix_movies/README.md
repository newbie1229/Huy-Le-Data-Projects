## 📅 Decade with the most movies/shows:

🔹 The 2010s is the decade that had the most movies/shows, with 3461 movies/shows in total, this can be interpreted for some reasons:
    
    🌐 The Internet booming paving the way for:
    - Viral marketing
    - Easier access to Netlix platforms
    - Netflix's switching from DVDs to streaming in 2007

🔹From the 2020s decade, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the numbers of movies/shows declined sharply.

📌 *As we can see from the line chart, the fluctuation is very significant.*
