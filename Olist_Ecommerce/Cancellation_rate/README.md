## ❓ What helps Olist Ecommerce Marketplace have such low cancellation rate ?

## 🚚 Stable delivery time

🔹 The average delivery time of all 71 product categories is **8.7 days**, a relatively reasonable timeframe for an Ecommerce Marketplace operating in a large and geographically diverse country like Brazil.

🔹 The scatterplot below shows that most of the canceled orders have delivery time around 9 days - not far from the average delivery time. Very few canceled orders have delivery time longer than 10 days, indicating that Olist is doing good at stablizing delivery time, ensuring their customers have a clear expectation about when they can get their orders.
