# 🔍 What I found about customer behavior of Olist ecommerce marketplace:

## 📈 Purchase fluctuation:

![](images/fluctuation.png)

🔹 As we can see from the line chart, the fluctuation in the number of purchases is very significant, especially between August and September. This can be interpreted by the increase in delivery time:
- While August is the month with shortest delivery time **(6.25 days)**, September takes 2 days longer to complete an order **(8.64 days)**.

- September is the first month to witness an increase after a long period of declininf shipping time, so the drop in the purchase amount could be considered a response from customers.
